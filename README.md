# Whiteboard-08:  Merge Two Linked Lists

Directions:<br>
Write a function called merge that:
- Accepts two sorted Linked Lists
- Zips them together into one sorted Linked List

Be sure to draw pictures on the whiteboard to represent example input. Use psuedo code to engineer any particularly tricky pieces of code.

<br>
For Example:

Given:

Linked List #1:  8 -> 12 -> 14
Linked List #2:  9 -> 13

Returns:

Linked List #3:  8 -> 9 -> 12 -> 13 -> 14
